This is a fork of the [hugging-face/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) that is identical to the v4.56.1 release with one difference: a group beam search bug (described in issue [#41238](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/41238), [anmorgunov/huggingface-group-beam-search-bug](https://github.com/anmorgunov/huggingface-group-beam-search-bug) for a working example) is patched.

The group beam search is marked for deprecation in the next releases, so this fork was created for internal use of libraries that utilize the group beam search in transformers library.
